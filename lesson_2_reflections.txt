What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	it creates the .git file and starts your repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The statging area only contains changes that you feel need to be commited at this time,.  Changes could have been made elsewhere, but not commited to yet

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	You can stage one file at a time to ensure that only changes you want commited get commited together for a logical change.
